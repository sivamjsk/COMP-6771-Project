### Abstract

This project aims to compare two different tech-
niques for white balancing images: gray world and convolutional
neural network (CNN) approaches. Experimental analyzes are
performed on different datasets of images and the results are
evaluated against objective measures such as color accuracy,
contrast and noise. Our primary focus is on CNNs designed
to automatically learn features and patterns from raw pixel
data using convolutional and pooling layers to extract relevant
features. These networks have proven very successful in various
computer vision applications and are used in this study to better
understand white balance. This study provides valuable insight
into the relative merits and limitations of each method and
concludes with recommendations for practical use in imaging
applications.
